# pomodoro
This pomodoro was created with React Native and Firebase. The design is based on a "Frontend Mentor" project. Although it is already functional, there are a number of points that must be revisited, which I intend to do soon.

In order to use this app, one must have a Firebase project with "Email and Password" login service enabled and, furthermore, add the connection data of this Firebase project to the file "firebase-config.js", in folder "utils".
